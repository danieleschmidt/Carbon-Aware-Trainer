        carbon_threshold=100.0,    # gCO2/kWh threshold
        pause_threshold=150.0,     # Pause if above this
        resume_threshold=80.0      # Resume when below this
    )
    
    trainer = CarbonAwareTrainer(
        model=your_model,
        optimizer=your_optimizer,
        carbon_model='cached',     # Use offline data
        region='US-CA',
        config=config,
        api_key='/path/to/carbon_data.json'
    )
    
    async with trainer:
        # Training will automatically pause/resume based on carbon intensity
        for epoch in range(10):
            for batch in dataloader:
                loss = await trainer.train_step(batch)
        
        # Get carbon metrics
        metrics = trainer.get_carbon_metrics()
        print(f"Total emissions: {metrics['total_carbon_kg']} kg CO2")

asyncio.run(main())
```
